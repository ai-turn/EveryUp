# EveryUp Monitoring

EveryUp connects monitoring data to the places where users investigate availability, telemetry, and incidents. A single Docker Environment can contribute several kinds of data through its Docker Collector, while users can also configure supported monitoring capabilities independently.

## Language

**Docker Environment**:
A connected Docker host monitored through an EveryUp Docker Collector. Its discovered workloads and infrastructure data share the Docker Environment's Project membership.
_Avoid_: Agent, Project, Docker Project, server

**Docker Collector**:
The integrated Collector installed for one Docker Environment. It can collect Docker workload state, container logs, host metrics, and optional API or OpenTelemetry telemetry with one or more selected capabilities.
_Avoid_: Agent, Monitor

**Collector**:
A data-ingestion mechanism. The EveryUp Docker Collector is the integrated Docker path and can expose an authenticated OpenTelemetry gateway for its selected telemetry capabilities. A standard OpenTelemetry Collector can also send host metrics directly for an Infrastructure Resource.
_Avoid_: Project

**Docker Collection Profile**:
The set of monitoring capabilities enabled for a Docker Collector. A profile changes what the Collector runs and may be configured from a specific capability menu.
_Avoid_: Capability-specific Agent, Independent Collector

**Uptime Monitor**:
A configured availability check, such as HTTP or TCP, with its own target and schedule. It may run without a Docker Environment.
_Avoid_: Service, Project

**Observed Service**:
A workload discovered by a Collector or created for a direct telemetry connection, such as a Docker container or instrumented application. Its health, logs, API data, and metrics can be explored independently.
_Avoid_: Project

**Direct Telemetry Connection**:
An OTLP ingestion connection bound to one Observed Service. Its credential authorizes an explicit set of Logs, Metrics, and Traces signals and does not create a Docker Environment.
_Avoid_: Docker Environment, Docker Collector, Independent Collector

**Infrastructure Resource**:
A host or other operational resource whose capacity and availability are monitored. It can be backed by an EveryUp Docker Collector or by a directly configured standard OpenTelemetry Collector. A direct Infrastructure Resource may belong to a Project; a Docker-backed one inherits its Docker Environment's Project.
_Avoid_: Docker Environment, Docker Collector

**Project**:
An optional logical grouping of Docker Environments, independent Uptime Monitors, directly created Observed Services, and directly configured Infrastructure Resources. A Docker-discovered Observed Service, its logs, API data, metrics, and Infrastructure Resource inherit the Project of their Docker Environment.
_Avoid_: Docker Environment, Docker Project, server
